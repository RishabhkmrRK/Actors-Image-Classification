## Introduction
In this project, I have trained and deployed a machine learning model which classifies the Tv show "The Big Bang Theory" actors: Howard, Leonard, Raj and Sheldon. I used `Google images` for Gathering data, `Sklearn` libraries to train model and `Amazon Web Services EC2` Instance to deploy model.
